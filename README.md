You can easily create quotes and invoices with this application.  
Back end of this system is built in Python, Flask, SQLite, etc., that is easy to customize.  
And, the View layer uses Vue.js and is effective for design changes.  
Want to use another DB of your choice instead of SQLite?  
OK! So,as you like!  
We adopted SQLAlchemy as the SQL wrapper. You can use any DB that it supports.
